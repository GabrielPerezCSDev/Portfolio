Leveraging my interdisciplinary expertise in Chemical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, and Computer Science, I am actively seeking full-time opportunities in software development and related fields. My academic journey at Iowa State University, culminating in a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science (expected Fall 2024), has not only refined my problem-solving skills but has also fueled my passion for creating impactful software solutions.

Throughout my experiences, I have embraced diverse roles, from tutoring advanced subjects at Iowa State University to leading data-driven investigations at Mars-Wrigley Confectionary using tools like MATLAB. These roles have equipped me with a unique blend of analytical thinking and practical execution that I bring into every software project I undertake.

Key Projects:
- **Ascension Of Empires**: Spearheaded backend development using Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, and Docker, where I gained hands-on experience with scalable systems, REST APIs, and collaboration in a dynamic development team.
- **StarField Skirmish**: Developed a space-themed shooter game with an emphasis on dynamic alien ship generation and multi-level progression. This project strengthened my skills in game development and interactive user experiences.
- **Pokémon Game Simulation**: Created a complex simulation in C and C++, featuring random map generation, a CSV-based Pokémon database, and an expansive 400x400 grid world. This project tested my ability to manage large datasets and integrate advanced algorithms to improve game functionality.

In addition to my degree, my minor in Biomedical Engineering gives me a unique perspective on technology’s role in solving real-world challenges, especially in healthcare and biotechnology. I am excited to apply my diverse skill set to projects that require innovative thinking and software engineering.

I am eager to contribute to groundbreaking projects and collaborate with forward-thinking teams that value continuous learning and professional growth. Let’s connect and discuss how my background and skills can align with your organization’s needs.
