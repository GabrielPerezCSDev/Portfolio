                <p>
                    With a strong interdisciplinary foundation in Chemical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, and Computer Science, 
                    I am actively seeking full-time software development roles that allow me to tackle complex challenges and innovate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey at Iowa State University, where I am completing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (Fall 2024), 
                    has equipped me with both technical expertise and practical experience in software development.
